A SAS macro for setting optional axis ranges.

 The default axes produced by SAS/GRAPH and ODS Graphics often leave something to be desired.

    In SAS/GRAPH the tendancy is towards giving too many tick marks.
    In ODS Graphics the tendancy is to allow the min and max data values to be unbounded by tick marks.

The macro presented in these examples is one SAS programmer's attempt to improve upon these default axes.
